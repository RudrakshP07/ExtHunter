# ExtHunter
ExtHunter is a lightweight Bash tool that scans endpoint lists for URLs ending with sensitive file extensions like .env, .sql, .log, .zip, and more. Designed for recon workflows, it helps bug bounty hunters and security researchers quickly identify potential data leaks from large sets of discovered URLs.
