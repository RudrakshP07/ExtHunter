# ExtHunter

**ExtHunter** is a Bash-based passive reconnaissance utility that scans lists of gathered endpoints for file extensions that commonly indicate sensitive information leaks — such as `.env`, `.sql`, `.bak`, `.zip`, `.log`, and more.

## 🔍 Use Case

Ideal for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, or OSINT analysts who already have gathered endpoints (via tools like `waybackurls`, `gau`, or `katana`) and want to filter out the juicy ones quickly.
